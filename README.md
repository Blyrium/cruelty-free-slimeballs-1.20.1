Finding slimes to loot slimeballs is annoying, but it doesn't have to be this way! Introducing _Cruelty-Free Slimeballs_, a mod that makes slimeballs craftable.

It adds three recipes to the game, based on carrageenan, pectin, and xanthan gum.

**Xanthan gum recipe:**

_Wheat can be replaced by sugar cane or a bucket of milk._

Tested with Fabric API 0.91.0+1.20.1

This mod is provided "as is". It should technically work on all 1.20.X versions of the game. I am not planning to update/backport this mod to a different version of Minecraft. You're free to do so yourself, however.
